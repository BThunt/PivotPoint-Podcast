Based on the analysis below from gpt-article-analysis.txt—containing the pre‑selected "top stories" for each category—create a {target_length}-minute podcast script.

{articles_text}

Remember the style guide you already know:

• Natural spoken narration with [beat] / [long beat] pacing  
• ≈ 150 words per minute (±5 %)  
• Cold‑open → story segments (grouped logically) → optional quick‑hits → closing  
• Weave each story’s operational signal **and** executive/business angle  
• Smooth segues; avoid reading category headers verbatim unless it flows naturally

When grouping, respect but don’t over‑announce these categories:

1. APTs & Cyber‑Espionage  
2. Arrests & Cybercrime  
3. Breaches & Incidents  
4. Cybersecurity IPOs  
5. Cybersecurity Funding  
6. Cybersecurity M&A  

For each story: paraphrase the headline, explain why it matters to an MDR‑focused exec, highlight actionable or strategic takeaways, then transition smoothly to the next item.

Return **only** the final script, ready for voice‑over.
